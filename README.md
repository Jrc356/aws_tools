# Tools to make working with AWS just a little easier  
I have been working alot with AWS recently and there's a lot of steps that are just repetitive by nature. Each folder contains some simple tools to make things easier while working with AWS.  
  
# Setup
Each of the tools assumes you have the awscli installed and have run aws configure. They also assume that you have the proper permissions.
